Uses some lex/yacc magic to parse a SQL-based grammar. lex generates a lexer
and yacc generates a parser. The compilation process uses some magic
to concatenate the two C files together and somehow the whole thing works.
The output binary takes a single filename as a command-line argument and outputs
ACCEPT or REJECT depending on the contents of the file. You run it with
./p3 $filename
