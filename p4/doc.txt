This program is an extension of the previous parser project that also checks the semantic rules of C minus,
such as making sure that all variables used have been previously declared. It works by recursively descending
the parse tree made in the previous project. You run it using './p4 $filename', and it prints 'ACCEPT' or 
'REJECT' depending on if the contents of $filename correspond to a valid C minus program or not. 'make' is
not needed because the project is written in Python.
