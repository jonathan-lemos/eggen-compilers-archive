The purpose of this project is to separate an input string into a sequence of tokens that correspond to the terminals of the C- CFG. My program accomplishes this by repeatedly matching the beginning of each line with a series of regular expressions and subsequently removing the *longest* match until the string is blank. Whitespace is skipped over using .strip() and comments are handled using a boolean variable.

The makefile doesn't actually do anything because this project is written in Python which does not need to be compiled. The project is run using './p1 $filename'. The input is given through a file specified in the first command-line argument, and the output is given through stdout.
