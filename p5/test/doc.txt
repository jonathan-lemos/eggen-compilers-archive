This code generator generates druples corresponding to the input C- program. An input program must be semantically
correct, because this code generator needs the function table from the semantic analyzer. It works by using a lexer
to generate tokens, a parser to turn those tokens into a tree, and a code generator that walks the tree to
generate code. To be honest, I don't quite remember how the lexer or parser work, and I'm not really sure
how the code generator works either. You run it with `./p5 $filename`, and it'll print 'REJECT' if your input
file is bad, or a list of druples if it's good.
